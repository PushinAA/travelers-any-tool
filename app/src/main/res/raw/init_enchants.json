When the wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate type, he may choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel it through the weapon to the struck opponent, which suffers the effects of both the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has unlimited uses of a special ability, she may channel through the weapon every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with her conductive greatsword can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal both greatsword damage and damage from one use of lay on hands. A given character can use this weapon special ability only once per round (even if she has several conductive weapons), and the power works only with magical abilities of the same type as the weapon (melee or ranged).",

A suit of withstanding armor is inscribed with eldritch runes across its surface and decorated with the snarling countenances of specific creatures. Each suit of withstanding armor is tailored to a specific type of creature, chosen from the same list as the options for bane weapons. The wearer of this armor gains a +2 enhancement bonus on Knowledge checks related to the chosen type of creature, and when the wearer is struck by a sneak attack or a confirmed critical hit by creatures of the chosen type, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This does not stack with any other form of critical hit negation, such as that imposed by the fortification special ability.",

A shield with the wyrmsbreath special ability is keyed to one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The shield gains 1 charge for every 5 points of damage from the keyed energy type the wearer takes. On command, the bearer can expend 1 to 5 charges from the shield to have it create a breath weapon in a 15 foot cone dealing 1d4 points of energy damage per charge expended (Reflex DC 11 half). This damage is the same type as the shield’s keyed energy type. A shield can store up to 5 charges at a time, and stored charges expire harmlessly after 24 hours.
