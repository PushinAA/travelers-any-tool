The centerpiece of o-yoroi is a cuirass consisting of two parts—a separate reinforcement for the right side called a waidate, and a kikko cuirass. The upper part of the waidate consists of a leather-covered iron plate. The cuirass’s leather shoulder straps—called watagami—are likewise armored with metal plates. Affixed to the cuirass are a number of supplementary pieces, including wide lamellar shoulder guards, a kikko sleeve for the shield arm, lacquered iron greaves worn over padded silk leggings, and a groin protector. The signature component of each suit of armor is the tiered kabuto helmet and its accompanying ho-ate mask. Ho-ate masks can be made of hardened leather or metal and are fashioned into fearsome visages such as oni, dragons, or other mythical beings.",

After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion).

Losing a weapon in such circumstances often made it irretrievable, and the axe-gauntlet became popular with rearguard warriors. Though these weapons have seen significantly less use since the dwarves reached the surface, some dwarven warriors still appreciate the reliability of such designs.

It takes 1 minute to pry a grappling hook free. The rope attached to a grappling hook can be cut, but pirates often target the rigging and masts to make it difficult to remove the hooks. Tying off the rope of a grappling hook is a move action.\n\nA grappling hook can also be used as a ranged weapon. If you are proficient in the grappling hook, it is a grappling weapon. On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. You can attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple your opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the target with a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the grapple. If you move far enough away to be out of the weapon’s reach, the grapple ends.\n\nA grappling hook’s weight includes the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope. It can be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope.",

        "description": "A corvus is a boarding device that features a hinged counterweight system for mounting a bridge vertically on a siege tower or a vehicle, with a hooked end to grab onto a target vehicle or structure. A corvus is usually 10 feet wide and 15 feet long. It has a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per square. Using a corvus requires a DC 10 Profession (siege engineer) check as a full-round action; if the check fails, the corvus fails to catch on the target and must be reset (a full-round action). A corvus mounted on a vehicle can target another moving vehicle (see Chapter 4: Vehicles). Doing so requires an opposed driving check to get the corvus into the correct position, which is within the length of the corvus and adjacent to the other vehicle. Once a corvus is attached, it takes a Strength check as a full-round action to dislodge the corvus. Alternatively, if the corvus is attached to a vehicle, either vehicle driver can make a driving check as a standard action to dislodge the corvus (a check that succeeds by 5 or more destroys the corvus). The base DC for either of these checks is 15, and the DC increases by 5 for every Small or Medium creature currently standing on the corvus. If a corvus is disengaged while creatures are standing on it, those creatures must make a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or fall. Succeeding at the saving throw allows them to move to the nearest area of safe ground, but such movement provokes attacks of opportunity. A corvus cannot be armored.",

Most are of flimsy construction, but rare examples are more stoutly built (use the rules for giving siege engines armor, and adjust AC, hardness, and hit points accordingly).

A candle made from alchemical candle wax normally possesses a sweet, honeylike smell, but a character who is trained in Craft (alchemy) can infuse the wax with nearly any scent available to her. A character trained in both Craft (alchemy) and Craft (poison) can infuse one candle’s worth of wax with any alchemical substance that requires inhalation, such as a vial of alchemical pheromones (see below) or a dose of inhaled poison. When infusing the wax with poison, the normal rules for exposing oneself to poison apply. Only one kind of alchemical substance can be infused into a single candle at a time, though a single candle can hold up to 3 doses of a substance. A single lump of alchemical candle wax is enough to create one candle.\n\nAfter burning for 1 minute, the alchemical candle releases the chosen alchemical substance as a colorless haze that lingers in a 5-foot radius centered on the candle for up to 1 hour, plus 30 minutes for each dose or vial of a substance infused into the candle wax beyond the first. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the haze in 2 rounds; a strong or stronger wind (21+ mph) disperses the haze immediately.

When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast. If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper, hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object’s hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each.",

Ifrits are especially known for their fondness for fire ink, and ifrit fire-dancers often decorate their skin with flaming designs before performing. A concentrated version of the ink costs 10 times as much and can be used to make permanently glowing tattoos.",

When introduced into a dead body, necrobane formaldehyde slows the process of decay, keeping the corpse from stinking and rotting for 1d6 days after death. Treating a body with necrobane formaldehyde takes 1 hour and requires a successful DC 25 Heal check. A corpse injected with necrobane formaldehyde is more difficult to resurrect as an undead creature for 1d6 days after injection. Anyone attempting to seed unlife in a corpse treated in this substance must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check to complete the process or the spell fails and its components are wasted. This is also the case for creatures that ingest necrobane formaldehyde and subsequently die before the effect’s duration has expired.\n\nIf an undead creature ingests necrobane formaldehyde (perhaps by eating part of an embalmed corpse), the undead creature becomes fatigued for 2d6 rounds.\n\nWhen ingested by a living creature, necrobane formaldehyde nauseates the imbiber for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to sickened and halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1). This is a poison effect, though the pungent aroma and unmistakably toxic taste of necrobane formaldehyde makes it difficult to use as a surreptitious weapon.",

Due to its unpredictable nature, petrified ooze is typically only good for breaking or melting whatever object or device on which the user originally sets the ooze, after which the blob quickly scurries into the nearest corner or crevice so it can feed on particles of dust and diminutive prey. Once restored to its viscous form, a petrified ooze moves at a rate of 60 feet per round, and any creature that comes in contact with the ooze must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid taking acid damage from it.",

The reanimated corpse remains utterly lifeless and is driven only by muscular spasms that cause it shuffle 20 feet in a random direction each round, gasping and blinking eerily as it goes.

On a 1, it continues forward in the same direction it had been previously moving (or runs up against the same barrier). On a 2, it turns 45º clockwise and heads in that direction; on a 3, it turns 90º clockwise and heads in that direction; and so on.

Many crafters of these alchemical weapons take pride in painting or etching these bombs with complex scenes, or even making them look like small humanoid skulls, despite the fact that the bombs shatter when thrown. When thrown as a splash weapon, a smoke bomb bursts and fills the 5-foot square it detonates in with a cloud of thick, foul-smelling gray smoke (treat this area as if affected by a fog cloud spell, except that the cloud lasts only 1 round before dissipating). A creature that is struck by a smoke bomb or that passes through the cloud a bomb creates must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 3 rounds after that. Creatures within 5 feet of where the flask hits are sickened for 1 round if they fail this saving throw. This is a poison effect.

As a standard action, a stick of tiller’s gum can be imbued with a spell of up to 3rd level with a casting time of less than 1 minute and that targets one or more creatures, as if the gum were the target of the spell. The gum holds the spell’s charge for 1 hour, during which time a creature capable of casting the stored spell can chew the gum as a standard action to gain the spell’s effects, expending the stored spell and destroying the gum. The stored spell uses the original caster’s level to determine its effects. If the spell-imbued gum isn’t used before an hour passes, it is ruined. Crafting a stick of tiller’s gum requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.",

A catfolk can detect a particular scent applied with a trailscent kit from 30 feet away.

A catfolk with the scent racial quality doubles those distances. A scent impression lasts for 1 year or until it is washed away. Each kit has 10 uses.",

When preparing a spell, you can grind the spell’s material components and mix them into this paste to paint the components directly onto your flesh, allowing you to cast that spell as if you had applied Eschew Materials. Additionally, by painting complex woad designs that symbolize gestures for 10 minutes and succeeding at a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level, you can also cast the spell as if you had applied Still Spell. You can have only one spell painted on you in this way at a time, and if you cast the prepared spell or the paint is removed for any reason, the effects of the woad paint are spent.\n\nWoad paint is sold in small, concentrated blocks (costing 60 gp each) that must be ground into paste on a wooden or stone pallet with a small amount of water and material spell components. A typical kit contains a pallet and 5 small blocks of paint. One block produces enough paint for 10 component designs or one stilled spell design. Woad paint has no benefit for a non-spellcaster.",

Perfect ice is an alchemically engineered form of water that briefly converts any moisture it touches into a similar state. When a flask of perfect ice is opened or broken (such as by being thrown as a splash weapon), the snowflake within expands rapidly, forming a layer of ice and snow with a 60-foot radius along any nearby surface. Any living creature that touches an area of perfect ice or starts its turn in a space of perfect ice takes 4d6 points of damage from desiccation as some of the water in its body crystallizes (Fortitude DC 18 half). Creatures with the water subtype take half again as much damage (150%) and receive no saving throw. The ice crystals that form along flat surfaces are large and strong, and are treated as caltrops. The ice persists for 10 minutes, after which it vaporizes or reverts to a normal state for its temperature. To avoid the hazards of its large area of effect, many users propel the vial from a launching crossbow (Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer’s Armory 4) or use similar means to extend their throwing range.",

The application of the powder depends on the disease from which it is refined. Someone using powder made from diseases contracted by ingestion must apply it to food (a full-round action) for the victim to consume. Those using powder made from diseases contracted by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a standard action, as per the poison application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the contagion. Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by throwing it into the air. Throwing a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a save with a DC equal to that of the disease from which the powder is made to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt the same save with a +4 bonus. Diseases spread through contact can use any of the three manners of application.\n\nThe most common disease refined for these powders is filth fever, costing 144 gp, but refined plague powders of other diseases are available, with a price equal to the base save DC of the disease squared. Making a plague powder always requires access to a sample of the disease and exposes the creator to the disease in question each day of crafting.

When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.\n\nA creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.

Once per week, while a living creature wears a suit of diviner’s blight armor, the wearer can recite a command word and spend 1 minute in concentration to have the armor imitate a creature with which the wearer is familiar. The imitated creature must be within one size category of the wearer. Imitating a creature has no visible effect on the armor or the wearer, but instead confounds magical divinations. Spells such as scrying meant to observe the imitated creature instead observe the wearer, who appears to the scryer as the imitated creature; the imitated creature still attempts any necessary saving throw or applies its spell resistance, but if the spell succeeds, diviner’s blight redirects any scrying sensor to its wearer. Magical means of detecting a creature’s location always consider the location of the wearer as the actual location of the imitated creature, and only 8th-level or higher spells like discern location or greater prying eyes can overcome this effect. Spells such as detect lies or zone of truth react as though the wearer were the imitated target and not himself, but only for the purpose of stating his identity. Diviner’s blight would not, for instance, affect a question about the wearer’s mother’s name. The imitation remains in place until the wearer chooses a different creature to imitate or spends 1 minute in concentration to end it. The armor resumes its normal form when removed, but the target of its imitative effect remains set—when a character dons the armor (whether the character who dons the armor is the last wearer or a different person), the armor immediately begins imitating the creature it’s set to imitate again.",

A creature that strikes the wearer with a bite attack is affected the same way, even if it possesses exceptional reach and attacks while not adjacent to the wearer. If the wearer is swallowed whole, the attacker is automatically sickened and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn or be forced to regurgitate and drop the wearer harmlessly in an adjacent square (though the wearer is knocked prone during the regurgitation). Creatures with the scent ability suffer a –2 penalty to their saving throw against the stench of the otyugh armor. These abilities are poison effects; creatures immune to poison are immune to these effects as well. The wearer is immune to this effect. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on saves against disease, poison, and any effect that would cause her to become nauseated or sickened.",

If the wielder succeeds at the grapple, the sword’s blade transforms into a metal chain and wraps around the target, giving the wielder a +5 bonus on further grapple checks against the target. If the target escapes the grapple or the wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle). The wielder can also let go of the chain’s handle while grappling or pinning the target; if he does so, the chain remains in place and the target gains the entangled condition (Escape Artist DC 20 to slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain’s handle as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a swift action, which releases the bound creature. If the chain is destroyed, it reverts to sword form and the weapon gains the broken condition.",

Undead surrounded by this glow take 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turn. The wielder of a blade of the rising sun may declare a sacrificial strike (similar to the retributive strike of a staff of power) as a standard action, or as an immediate action before losing consciousness upon gaining the dying or dead condition. A sacrificial strike converts the wielder’s body and spirit into raw energy equivalent to a sunburst (DC 22). Allies of the wielder within the sunburst are not harmed, and the wielder may choose to affect all allies within the sunburst as mass cure light wounds or all allies within 10 feet as breath of life. The caster level for the effects of the sacrificial strike is equal to the sword’s caster level plus 1/2 the wielder’s level (maximum 25th level). A sacrificial strike destroys the wielder’s body (as the spell disintegrate), but she has a 50% chance of being reincarnated (as the reincarnate spell) 24 hours after performing a sacrificial strike in a random safe location within 1 mile. The wielder’s gear is left behind unharmed after the sacrificial strike; however, the blade of the rising sun is teleported to a random location at least 100 miles distant.",

The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property.

      "name" : "Shadowcraft Weapon",
      "description" : "This highly malleable weapon is forged from insubstantial darkness using a combination of illusion and transmutation magic. Each shadowcraft weapon is designed with a base type (melee or ranged) and handedness (one-handed or two-handed for ranged weapons, and light, one-handed, or two-handed for melee weapons). Ranged shadowcraft weapons that use ammunition create their own projectiles out of shadow, but they can be loaded with and fire other types of ammunition, as well. The wielder of a shadowcraft weapon can alter the weapon’s shape as a standard action simply by picturing the form she wishes it to assume. A shadowcraft weapon can assume the form of any masterwork weapon that shares its type and handedness, regardless of its categorization as simple, martial, or exotic. Shadowcraft weapons are able to take the shape of weapons of different size categories, as long as they would be treated as the appropriate level of handedness for the shadowcraft weapon’s true size. For example, a Medium two-handed melee shadowcraft weapon can become a greatsword sized for a Medium creature, or a longsword sized for a Large creature (which a Medium creature would treat as a two-handed weapon). Shadowcraft weapons are quasi-real and deal less damage if an opponent realizes this. The first time each round that a creature is hit with a shadowcraft weapon, that creature can attempt a Will saving throw to disbelieve (DC = 15 + twice the weapon’s enhancement bonus, if any). On a failed check, the weapon deals damage normally. On a successful save, all of the weapon’s attacks against that creature do minimum damage until the wielder’s next turn, and that creature gains a +4 bonus on subsequent saving throws to disbelieve the attacks of that wielder’s shadowcraft weapon. Shadowcraft weapons deal only 1 point of damage to objects. In addition, the wielder of a shadowcraft weapon gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and adds +1 to the save DC to disbelieve the attack if the opponent is in an area of dim light or darkness. In contrast, the wielder takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls and to the save DC to disbelieve the attack if the opponent is in an area of bright light. A shadowcraft weapon can be enhanced like any other masterwork weapon and it retains all of its abilities between transformations, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a keen shadowcraft weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the keen special ability while in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. A shadowcraft weapon retains the last appearance it was commanded to assume until its wielder commands it to assume a different form. The following advanced weapons build upon the malleable nature of shadowcraft weaponry by adding additional powers, abilities, and bonuses to those listed above. Like standard shadowcraft weapons, the following weapons can be further enhanced. If an advanced shadowcraft weapon doesn’t note a specific handedness or weapon type, it can be created as a weapon of any handedness or weapon type of the crafter’s choice. Shadowcraft weapons are tied to deities that grant the Darkness domain. While any character can wield them, the churches of the deities to which they are connected often see them as holy relics.",

Three times per day, the wielder can fire two invisible magical bolts that deal no damage. These bolts must each be fired at a solid surface, into which they embed themselves. As long as both bolts have an unobstructed line between them, no longer than 180 feet, they create an invisible 1-inch-wide line between themselves. The wearer is mentally alerted anytime a visible Tiny or larger creature passes through this line, and gains a vision of the creature’s appearance. Creatures that can see invisible objects can see the line, and if they recognize it for what it is, they can duck under it or leap over it, thus avoiding detection.

The wearer can remove the spearhead as a standard action to resume using the spearhead as an amulet, causing the spear to revert to its original, non-magical form. The spearhead also functions as a unique divination device. Each spearhead can be magically linked with another spearhead by touching the two together as a full-round action. This creates a one-way link between the two. Once per day, the holder of the spearhead can cast scrying to observe a linked spearhead.

If no poison is applied to the stirge lancet, it instead attaches to the target for 1 round and draws 1 ounce of blood or an equivalent fluid (if any) from the target.

Although a stirge lancet leaves no evidence, the sound of its buzzing wings may attract attention. A creature hit by a stirge lancet can attempt a Perception check to hear its humming; the DC for this check is equal to 20 + the stirge lancet’s enhancement bonus on attack rolls (DC 21 for a standard stirge lancet). If the target succeeds at this Perception check, it instinctively attempts to bat the dart out of the air without a second thought, thinking the projectile to be an ordinary insect. There is a 50% chance that a dart so detected is batted from the sky, preventing it from returning to the creature that fired it and allowing it to be detected with a successful DC 15 Perception check, as normal for a featherweight dart.

Once per day, the wielder can swing the Blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun Blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun Blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded.

Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material. In the event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to the sword’s tenth slot, the sword’s wielder decides which of the weapon’s two properties will be in effect when the ring is placed.

The wearer of the jailer’s ring can also remove a linked prisoner’s ring at any time. The jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked prisoner’s ring like a constant status spell. Additionally, all wearers of linked prisoner’s rings count as familiar to the jailer for purposes of spells such as scrying and teleport.",

A ring of culturemeld slightly alters the wearer’s words to be more appropriate to the listener’s culture and expectations, granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on language-based Diplomacy checks. If worn by a half-elf, a ring of culturemeld grants the wearer the ability to speak and understand an additional language dependent on the local area. If the wearer spends 1 day in a settlement the size of a village or larger, the ring becomes attuned to any dominant language spoken there other than Common. After the ring is attuned, the wearer gains that language as a bonus language (if she didn’t already know it), though she can only speak and understand it. After 4 more days of attunement, the wearer gains the ability to read the language as well, though not the ability to write that language, and gains a +5 competence bonus on opposed Sense Motive checks against speakers of the attuned language. These benefits expire once the wearer has been out of contact with people who speak the attuned language for longer than 1 day or when the ring becomes attuned to a new language.",

This activation causes one of the ring’s nine garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring’s power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect’s duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed. The price of the ring is reduced by 5,000 gp for each of its garnets that has been destroyed.",

Obscure locations or locations controlled by a divinity cannot be focused on—in all cases, the GM has final say on whether a region can be focused upon. If the wearer casts plane shift to travel to the focused location while the map is active, she arrives without error at the site, rather than 5d% miles away.

      "description" : "This ring has two modes of operation: one for when the wearer is in dim light or outdoors at night, and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night. At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command. The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer’s choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round. The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage.",

As the years passed by, the rings were cast aside or lost. Recently, several resurfaced, but changed by unknown means— the former king’s face now bears a sorrowful expression, and flames loom behind him. As a standard action, you may charge the ring with a +1 profane bonus by sacrificing 2 of your hit points. These hit points remain lost and cannot be healed by any means until the ring’s power is expended. You may do this multiple times, up to a maximum of a +5 profane bonus stored in the ring. As an immediate action, you can add the stored profane bonus to any single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw, which expends the charged energy from the ring. You must declare this use after rolling the die but before you learn the result of the roll. You must expend all the ring’s power at once. Once the charge is expended, you can heal your lost hit points normally. Expending this charge does not ruin the ring, and you may charge it again by sacrificing more hit points. The charge in the ring can come from multiple donors, but none of the donors can regain their sacrificed hit points until the ring’s charge is spent or the ring is destroyed. For this reason, owners of a ring of terrible cost guard the item carefully.",

This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. The ram is Large and uses the ring’s caster level as its base attack bonus with a Strength of 25. This gives the ram a Combat Maneuver Bonus of +17. The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended. In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. This expends 1 charge. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29. A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.",

Once per day, the wearer of this ring can perform a complex mental and verbal ritual, repeatedly whispering the ring’s command word, while touching any humanoid corpse that has been dead for less than 1 week. The creature must have had 7 Hit Dice or fewer in life. This ritual can be as short as 1 round or could last up to 24 hours. It requires both total focus and constant contact between the ring, the wearer, and the target corpse. Interruption of any kind spoils the ritual, requiring the wearer to begin anew. The wearer of the ring chooses how long this ritual will last, but that decision must be made before she begins the ritual. On the ritual’s completion, an illusory duplicate of the creature touched—partially real and formed of animate ice cloaked in magical shadow—springs into existence. This functions as lesser simulacrum in all ways unless stated otherwise. The wearer of this ring gains a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when performing this ritual. The shadow creature appears in all ways to be hearty and full of life, equipped with all of the gear and clothing that was carried or worn by the corpse throughout the ritual. At the same moment the shadow creature is completed, the targeted corpse and all of its attendant equipment vanishes, melting away like snow. The false creature brought into existence by the ring of the shadow victim has the same base ability scores, type, and subtype as the targeted corpse. It appears in all ways to be the same individual as the corpse touched, and it retains the general personality, attitude, abilities, and intellect of that creature. However, this duplicate doesn’t possess any memories that the wearer of the ring doesn’t also possess, has no spell-like or supernatural abilities, can’t use activated extraordinary abilities, can’t gain the benefits of healing, can’t gain levels or increase its abilities, and can’t have more than 3 Hit Dice. This false creature behaves much like the target did in life, except it has a starting attitude of helpful toward the ring’s wearer and is generally willing to assist the wearer in any endeavor. The shadow creature will take nearly any action to aid the wearer of the ring, including dangerous, foolish or suicidal actions. This semi-illusory creature remains in existence for a duration equal to 7 × the length of the initial ritual that created it, until the wearer removes the ring of the shadow victim, until the wearer activates the ring again, or until the creature is destroyed by violence, whichever comes first. At that time, the duplicate vanishes and the original corpse, unchanged from when the initial ritual was completed, appears in its place.",

In such an event, neither wearer is entitled to a saving throw and both are compelled by the lesser geas to fulfill the terms of the agreement. If the wearer of the servant ring is unwilling to agree to such a contract, she can always select a lesser geas such as “remove the lesser geas from me.” As long as a lesser geas imposed by a ring of bondage remains in effect, neither ring can be removed. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of the lesser geas remain in place, but the surviving ring can’t create a new lesser geas until the missing ring is repaired or replaced.

Contract rings grant a +10 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks made against the other wearer, and creatures wearing linked contract rings can understand each other’s language. Once per day, Contract rings can seal a contract. The two wearers join hands and willingly state what each is agreeing to. Once both agree, each wearer accepts a lesser geas (no save) to fulfill the terms of the contract. This function does not occur if either character is under a mind-affecting effect or threat that forces her agreement. This compulsion lasts 7 days, starting immediately. While the lesser geas remains in effect, neither wearer can remove her ring, and neither ring can establish another lesser geas. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of any active lesser geas remain for both creatures, but the surviving ring becomes nonfunctional once the lesser geas expires until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If one wearer’s lesser geas is broken, the other wearer’s is removed.",

For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod’s energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know. A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod’s remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.

When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the climbing pole by pushing button 5. The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.

The wielder selects which of the following curses affects the target: –2 penalty to Strength (target’s Strength cannot be reduced below 1); –1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks; or target has a 20% chance to begin each round with the staggered condition. On a successful critical hit, the wielder can inflict two distinct curses if the target fails its save. Otherwise, a target can be subject to only one curse at a time. Curses inflicted from the rod of minor curses last for 5 minutes. They can also be removed with any spell that can remove the effects of bestow curse.",

After successfully casting the pit spell, the rod’s wielder can choose to manifest the contained spell inside the summoned pit.

Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer’s rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such. In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves’ tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command. Lastly, if the rod’s bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves’ tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod’s wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap’s placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.",

The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (a free action), the staff deals double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round. A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 x the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 x the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01—50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.",
